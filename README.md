## Installation
Build from source:  
For Linux:  
Along with >=Python3.8 you need to have Poetry installed, then just run the command:
`poetry build`  
to build the project. The package will be saved to `dist` folder, from where you can install it with `pip install filename`  
For Windows:  
Download the repository and on `cmd ` run `pip install path to local repository`

## Contributing
Contributions are welcomed, always fun to collaborate:)  
Some rules:

Please focus hard on the naming of functions, classes, and variables.  
Help your reader by using descriptive names that can help you to remove redundant comments.  
Expand acronyms because `dfp()` is hard to understand but `download_full_playlist()` is not.
Use type hints for your functions.
